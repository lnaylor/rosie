This action will move the robot to the given target
If it is an object, the robot will face the object and drive up to it
If it is a location or waypoint, the robot will navigate through the environment to it
	using op_go-to-waypoint1
If no target is given, or it is a nearby place (e.g. go to the end of the hall)
	We issue a go command (drive-forward)
