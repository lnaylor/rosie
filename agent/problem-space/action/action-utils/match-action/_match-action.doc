#                     match-action 
# Used to match an action-operator against a set of candidates
# Note: These rules are chunking friendly (yay!)
# 
# Usage: create the following structure on a state
# (state <s> ^match-action <info>)
# (<info> ^action <a> # This is an action-operator representation
#         ^candidates <cands>)
# (<cands> ^candidate <c1> <c2> ...) # One per candidate
# (<c1> ^action <ca1>) # These are action-operator representations
# (<c2> ^action <ca2>)
# ...
# 
# Through a series of elaboration rules, any candidates that match
# the given action will be elaborated with ^matches-action yes
#
